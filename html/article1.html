                <h2>Is time travel possible?</h2>
                <h1>Science says time travel is possible, but probably not in the way you're thinking.</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Is time travel possible? Short answer: Yes</strong>, and you're doing it right now — hurtling into the future at the impressive rate of one second per second. You're pretty much always moving through time at the same speed, whether you're watching paint dry or wishing you had more hours to visit with a friend from out of town. 
                    But this isn't the kind of time travel that's captivated countless science fiction writers, or spurred a genre so extensive that Wikipedia lists over 400 titles in the category "Movies about Time Travel." In franchises like "Doctor Who," "Star Trek," and "Back to the Future" characters climb into some wild vehicle to blast into the past or spin into the future. Once the characters have traveled through time, they grapple with what happens if you change the past or present based on information from the future (which is where time travel stories intersect with the idea of <a href=""><strong>parallel universes</strong></a> or alternate timelines).

                <p>
                    Although many people are fascinated by the idea of changing the past or seeing the future before it's due, no person has ever demonstrated the kind of back-and-forth time travel seen in science fiction, or proposed a method of sending a person through significant periods of time that wouldn't destroy them on the way. And, as physicist <strong>Stephen Hawking</strong> pointed out in his book "<strong>Black Holes and Baby Universes</strong>" (Bantam, 1994), "The best evidence we have that time travel is not possible, and never will be, is that we have not been invaded by hordes of tourists from the future."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Science does support some amount of time-bending, though. For example, physicist <strong>Albert Einstein's theory</strong> of <strong>special relativity</strong> proposes that time is an illusion that moves relative to an observer. 
                    An observer traveling near the <a href="https://www.space.com/15830-light-speed.html">speed of light</a> will experience time, with all its aftereffects (boredom, aging, etc.) much more slowly than an observer at rest. That's why astronaut <strong>Scott Kelly</strong> aged ever so slightly less over the course of a year in orbit than his twin brother who stayed here on Earth. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are other scientific theories about time travel, including some weird physics that arise around <strong>wormholes</strong>, <a href=""><strong>black holes</strong></a> and <strong>string theory</strong>. 
                    For the most part, though, <strong>time travel</strong> remains the domain of an ever-growing array of science fiction books, movies, television shows, comics, video games and more.

                <h2>Special relativity and time travel to the near future</h2>

                <p>Einstein developed his theory of special relativity in 1905. Along with his later expansion, the theory of general relativity, it has become one of the foundational tenets of modern physics. Special relativity describes the relationship between space and time for objects moving at constant speeds in a straight line. 

                    The short version of the theory is deceptively simple. First, all things are measured in relation to something else — that is to say, there is no "absolute" frame of reference. Second, the speed of light is constant. It stays the same no matter what, and no matter where it's measured from. And third, nothing can go faster than the speed of light.
                    
                    From those simple tenets unfolds actual, real-life time travel. An observer traveling at high velocity will experience time at a slower rate than an observer who isn't speeding through space. 
                    
                    While we don't accelerate humans to near-light-speed, we do send them swinging around the planet at 17,500 mph (28,160 km/h) aboard the <a href="https://www.space.com/16748-international-space-station.html">International Space Station</a>. Astronaut Scott Kelly was born after his twin brother, and fellow astronaut, <strong>Mark Kelly</strong>. Scott Kelly spent 520 days in orbit, while Mark logged 54 days in space. The difference in the speed at which they experienced time over the course of their lifetimes has actually widened the age gap between the two men.
                    
                    "So, where[as] I used to be just 6 minutes older, now I am 6 minutes and 5 milliseconds older," Mark Kelly said in a panel discussion on July 12, 2020, Space.com previously reported. "Now I've got that over his head."

                <p>
                    The difference that low earth orbit makes in an astronaut's life span may be negligible — better suited for jokes among siblings than actual life extension or visiting the distant future — but the dilation in time between people on Earth and GPS satellites flying through space does make a difference.

                    The Global Positioning System, or GPS, helps us know exactly where we are by communicating with a network of a few dozen satellites positioned in a high Earth orbit. The satellites circle the planet from 12,500 miles (20,100 kilometers) away, moving at 8,700 mph (14,000 km/h).

                    According to special relativity, the faster an object moves relative to another object, the slower that first object experiences time. For GPS satellites with atomic clocks, this effect cuts 7 microseconds, or 7 millionths of a second, off each day, according to American Physical Society publication Physics Central.

                </figure>
                <p>General relativity might also provide scenarios that could allow travelers to go back in time, according to 
                    <strong>NASA</strong>. But the physical reality of those time-travel methods are no piece of cake. 
                    <strong>wormholes</strong> are theoretical "tunnels" through the fabric of space-time that could connect different moments or locations in reality to others. Also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges or white holes, as opposed to black holes, speculation about wormholes abounds. But despite taking up a lot of space (or space-time) in science fiction, no wormholes of any kind have been identified in real life. 
                </p>
                <p>"The whole thing is very hypothetical at this point," Stephen Hsu, a professor of theoretical physics at the University of Oregon, 
                    told <a href="https://www.livescience.com/33730-science-fiction-fact-wormhole-space-travel.html?_ga=2.214852245.306252299.1507911823-847665129.1473360481">Space.com sister site Live Science</a>.
                     "No one thinks we're going to find a wormhole anytime soon."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The new theory, which suggests that wormholes could work as viable space-time shortcuts, was described by physicist Pascal Koiran. As part of the study, Koiran used the Eddington-Finkelstein metric, as opposed to the Schwarzschild metric which has been used in the majority of previous analyses.

                <p>Time travel has long occupied a significant place in fiction. Since as early as the "Mahabharata," an ancient Sanskrit epic poem compiled around 400 B.C., humans have dreamed of warping time, Lisa Yaszek, a professor of science fiction studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, 
                        <a href="https://www.livescience.com/time-travel-origins.html">told Live Science</a>. 
                        Every work of time-travel fiction creates its own version of space-time, glossing over one or more scientific hurdles and paradoxes to achieve its plot requirements. 
                        
                        Some make a nod to research and physics, like <a href="https://www.space.com/27692-science-of-interstellar-infographic.html">"Interstellar"</a>, a 2014 film directed by Christopher Nolan. In the movie, a character played by Matthew McConaughey spends a few hours on a planet orbiting a supermassive black hole, but because of time dilation, observers on Earth experience those hours as a matter of decades. 
                        
                        Others take a more whimsical approach, like the "Doctor Who" television series. The series features the Doctor, an extraterrestrial "Time Lord" who travels in a spaceship resembling a blue British police box. "People assume," the Doctor explained in the show, "that time is a strict progression from cause to effect, but actually from a non-linear, non-subjective viewpoint, it's more like a big ball of wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff." 
                        
                        Long-standing franchises like the "Star Trek" movies and television series, as well as comic universes like DC and Marvel Comics revisit the idea of time travel over and over.
