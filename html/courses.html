                Learn about the science behind the current exploration of the solar system in this free class. 
                Use principles from physics, chemistry, biology, and geology to understand the latest from Mars, 
                comprehend the outer solar system, ponder planets outside our solar system, and search for habitability in our neighborhood and beyond. 
                This course is generally taught at an advanced level assuming a prior knowledge of undergraduate math and physics,
                but the majority of the concepts and lectures can be understood without these prerequisites. 
                The quizzes and final exam are designed to make you think critically about the material you have learned rather than to simply make you memorize facts. 
                The class is expected to be challenging but rewarding.

                We will discuss that how quantum physics and time travel are associated with each other. 
                We start from basics and end on where quantum physics and time travel have a strong bond between them. 
                The Schrodinger wave equation is actually a nice explanation of quantum physics and time travel.
                Students will master all the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and its applications. 
                This is a chocolate-like course. So the students from any background can take this course easily.

                As you will soon see, there’s a lot more up there than just stars…
                We will start with a quick tour of what you can see in the night sky.
                Next you will look at the Celestial Sphere, learn how the sky moves and how to navigate the heavens.
                Once you get your celestial bearings, you will learn to read a star chart and install a free planetarium program to help you simulate the night sky for any time of year.
                Using your free planetarium software you will tour the Heavens in all four seasons.
