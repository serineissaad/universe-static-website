                <h2>Do parallel universes exist? We might live in a multiverse.</h2>
                <h1>Sci-fi loves parallel universes. But could we really be in one?</h1>
                <p>
                    Parallel universes are no longer just a feature of a good sci-fi story. There are now some scientific theories that support the idea of parallel universes beyond our own. However, the multiverse theory remains one of the most controversial theories in science. 
                    Our universe is unimaginably big. Hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of <a href="https://www.space.com/25303-how-many-galaxies-are-in-the-universe.html"><strong>galaxies</strong></a>  spin through space, each containing billions or trillions of <a href="https://www.space.com/57-stars-formation-classification-">stars</a>. Some researchers studying models of the universe speculate that the universe's diameter could be 7 billion light-years across. Others think it could be infinite.
                    But is it all that's out there? Science fiction loves the idea of a parallel universe, and the thought that we might be living just one of an infinite number of possible lives. Multiverses aren't reserved for "Star Trek," "Spiderman" and "Doctor Who," though. Real scientific theory explores, and in some cases supports, the case for universes outside, parallel to, or distant from but mirroring our own. 
                    Multiverses and parallel worlds are often argued in the context of other major scientific concepts like the <a href="https://www.space.com/25126-big-bang-theory.html"><strong>Big Bang</strong></a>, <strong>string theory</strong> and <strong>quantum mechanics</strong>.

                <h2>Eternal Inflatation, The Big Bang Theory and Parallel Universes</h2>
                    <p>
                        Around 13.7 billion years ago, everything we know of was an infinitesimal singularity. Then, according to the Big Bang theory, it burst into action, inflating faster than the speed of light in all directions for a tiny fraction of a second. 
                        Before 10^-32 seconds had passed, the universe had exploded outward to 10^26 times its original size in a process called 
                        <a href="https://www.space.com/42261-how-did-inflation-happen-anyway.html"><strong>cosmic inflation</strong></a>. And that's all before the actual expansion of matter that we usually think of as the Big Bang itself, which was a consequence of all this inflation: As the inflation slowed, a flood of matter and radiation appeared, creating the classic Big Bang fireball, and began to form the atoms, molecules, stars and galaxies that populate the vastness of space that surrounds us. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But even if we could reach the next bubble, according to eternal inflation (combined with string theory), our familiar universe with its physical constants and habitable conditions could be totally different from the hypothetical bubble universe next to our own. 
                        "This picture of the universe, or multiverse, as it is called, explains the long-standing mystery of why the constants of nature appear to be fine-tuned for the emergence of life," Vilenkin wrote. "The reason is that intelligent observers exist only in those rare bubbles in which, by pure chance, the constants happen to be just right for life to evolve. The rest of the multiverse remains barren, but no one is there to complain about that."
                        Vilenkin's explanation implies that in some of the infinite bubble universes outside our own, there could be other intelligent observers. But in every instant that passes, we get farther away from them, and we will never intersect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Science does support some amount of time-bending, though. For example, physicist <strong>Albert Einstein's theory</strong> of <strong>special relativity</strong> proposes that time is an illusion that moves relative to an observer. 
                        An observer traveling near the <a href="https://www.space.com/15830-light-speed.html">speed of light</a> will experience time, with all its aftereffects (boredom, aging, etc.) much more slowly than an observer at rest. That's why astronaut <strong>Scott Kelly</strong> aged ever so slightly less over the course of a year in orbit than his twin brother who stayed here on Earth.

                <h2>Quantum mechanics and parallel universes</h2>
                <p>
                    Some researchers base their ideas of parallel universes on quantum mechanics, the mathematical description of subatomic particles. In quantum mechanics, multiple states of existence for tiny particles are all possible at the same time — a "wave function" encapsulates all of those possibilities. However, when we actually look, we only ever observe one of the possibilities. According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics as described by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, we observe an outcome when the wave function "collapses" into a single reality. 
                    But the many-worlds theory proposes instead that every time one state, or outcome, is observed, there is another "world" in which a different quantum outcome becomes reality. This is a branching arrangement, in which instant by instant, our perceived universe branches into near-infinite alternatives. Those alternate universes are completely separate and unable to intersect, so while there may be uncountable versions of you living a life that's slightly — or wildly — different from your life in this world, you'd never know it.

                <p>
                    The many-worlds theory is the most "courageous" take on the quandary of quantum mechanics, physicist Sean Carroll wrote in his book,
                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Something-Deeply-Hidden-Emergence-Spacetime/dp/1524743011?tag=georiot-us-default-20&ascsubtag=space-row-6861891397171105000-20&geniuslink=true">"<strong>Something Deeply Hidden: 
                        Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime</strong>"</a> (Dutton, 2019). He also argued that it is the most straightforward theory, although not without wrinkles.

                    Some physicists believe in a flatter version of multiple universes. That is, if the universe that we live in goes on forever, there are only so many ways that the building blocks of matter can arrange themselves as they assemble across infinite space. Eventually, any finite number of particle types must repeat a particular arrangement. Hypothetically, in a big enough space,
                     those particles must repeat arrangements as large as entire <a href="https://www.space.com/16080-solar-system-planets.html">solar systems</a> and galaxies.
                </p>
                <p>So, your entire life might be repeated elsewhere in the universe, down to what you ate for breakfast yesterday. At least, that's the theory.
                    But if the universe began at a finite point, as nearly every physicist agrees that it did, an alternate version of you likely doesn't exist, according to astrophysicist Ethan Siegel's 2015 Medium article. 
                    According to Siegel, "the number of possible outcomes from particles in any Universe interacting with one another tends towards infinity faster than the number of possible Universes increases due to inflation." 
                    "So what does this mean for you?" Siegel wrote. "It means it's up to you to make this Universe count."

                    In a relatively recent addition to the pantheon of multiverse theories, researchers from the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, have proposed that the universe began at the Big Bang — and on the opposite side of the Big Bang timeline, stretching backwards in time, a universe once existed that was the exact mirror image of our own. 
                    "Instead of saying there was a different universe before the bang, we're saying that the universe before the bang is actually, in some sense, an image of the universe after the bang," Neil Turok, a Perimeter Institute researcher,
                    told <a href="https://www.space.com/43007-universe-has-mirror-image-universe.html">Space.com sister site Live Science</a>.
                    That means everything — protons, electrons, even actions like cracking an egg — would be reversed. Antiprotons and positively charged electrons would make up atoms, while eggs would un-crack and make their way back inside chickens. Eventually, that universe would shrink down, presumably to a singularity, before expanding out into our own universe.
                    Seen another way, both universes were created at the Big Bang and exploded simultaneously backward and forward in time.

                <h2>Multiverse: arguments For AND Against</h2>
                <h4>Arguments FOR the multiverse theory</h4>
                <h5>Cosmic inflation</h5>
                <p>
                    Our universe grew exponentially in the first moments of its existence, but was this expansion uniform? If not, it suggests different regions of space grew at different rates — and may be isolated from one another.
                </p>
                <h5>Mathematical constants</h5>
                <p>
                    How are the laws of the universe so exact? Some propose that this happened only by chance — we are the one universe out of many that happened to get the numbers right. 
                </p>
                <h5>The observable universe</h5>
                <p>
                    What is beyond the edge of the observable space around us? No one knows for sure, and until we do (which could be never), the thought that ou universe extends indefinitely is an interesting one. 
                </p>

                <h4>Arguments AGAINST the multiverse theory</h4>
                <h5>Falsifiability</h5>
                <p>
                    There is no way for us to ever test theories of the multiverse. We will never see beyond the observable universe, so if there is no way to disprove the theories, should they even be given credence? 
                </p>
                <h5>Occam's razor</h5>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, the simplest ideas are the best. Some physicists argue that we don't need the multiverse theory at all. It doesn't solve any paradoxes, and only creates complications. 
                </p>
                <h5>No evidence</h5>
                <p>
                    Not only can we not disprove any multiverse theory, we can't prove them either. We currently have no evidence that multiverses exists, and everything we can see suggests there is just one universe — our own.

                    Countless works of myth and fiction draw from ideas of parallel universes and the multiverse. Overlapping worlds make appearances in Norse mythology as well as Buddhist and Hindu cosmology. The idea of multiple universes coming into contact showed up in print as early as Edwin A. Abbott's novella "Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions" (Seeley & Co., 1884), and can still be seen in recent movies such as the 2016 Marvel film "Doctor Strange." An entire genre of Japanese graphic novels, called isekai, deals with characters transported to parallel worlds, as described by the New York Public Library. 
                    And comics, as well as their corresponding movies, delve deeply into the idea of parallel worlds. Recent Marvel Comics' storylines (both film and in print), DC's Flashpoint arc and 2018's "Into the Spider-Verse" all explore multiple universes and the intersections between them.
                    This is an incomplete list of some appearances of multiverses, split-timeline universes and parallel universes in fiction:
